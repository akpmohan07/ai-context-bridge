## 🚀 The Problem

We've all been there:

```
🤖 Deep conversation with ChatGPT about complex project
📝 3 hours of back-and-forth, perfect context built up
🚫 "You've reached the maximum length for this conversation"
😤 Start new chat → Blank screen → Lost everything
⏰ Waste 30+ minutes trying to recreate context
```

**AI Context Bridge eliminates this pain forever.**

## ✨ The Solution

**One-click context continuation** that intelligently reuses tokens from your previous conversation:

- 🔄 **Automatic context extraction** from ChatGPT, Claude & more
- 🎯 **Intelligent token reuse** - preserve essential context, eliminate redundancy  
- 🚀 **One-click continuation** - seamless transition to new chat
- 🔒 **100% private** - all processing happens locally
- 🌐 **Cross-platform** - works across multiple AI platforms

## 💡 Inspired By

I was hitting ChatGPT conversation limits and searching for solutions when I found this Reddit thread:

> *"...possible edit your last message so it generates a new response with what you want"*

That's when it clicked: ask ChatGPT to summarize the conversation, then start fresh with that context.

It worked manually, but was tedious. So I automated it.

**Thanks to u/khanto0 for the original workaround that inspired this extension!**
